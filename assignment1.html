          <p>In the article "404 Page Not Found" by Kate Wagner, a compelling observation is made about the relationship between freedom of creativity and the current state of web design. In the early days of the internet, platforms like GeoCities and MySpace offered users the tools to build and customize their own web pages, and people ran wild with this freedom, resulting in web pages with what we would consider by today's standards to have "ugly design." Kate states, "we didn’t know it at the time, but the cluttered facade of MySpace pages would be the dying gasp of a natively vernacular web aesthetic, one defined by a lack of restriction on what the page could or should look like. Such a degree of customization is extremely rare today." This period reflects a time when the internet was more open and unrestricted, brand new really, and this allowed individuals to shape their digital experiences in a way that was deeply personal and expressive.</p>
          <p>What’s really fascinating is how that early sense of freedom contrasts sharply with the design trends of today. We now live in an era marked by minimalism—clean, flat designs that prioritize uniformity. This shift to minimalism can largely be attributed to capitalism, which is often touted as a system that fosters innovation. However, in the case of web design, capitalism appears to have had the opposite effect. Rather than pushing for more creative freedom or diverse expressions, it has led to a homogenized internet, where a handful of large companies dictate the aesthetic and functionality of online spaces. In the article, Wagner puts it quite bluntly: "websites had to either become apps or self-optimize for mobile, web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to become flat, highly minimalistic, and multi-platform, and the results are, frankly, fucking boring." Many websites are now forced into formatting for multiple devices, namely phones, meaning websites are now just turning into apps.</p>
          <p>Platforms like Facebook became dominant by offering a streamlined, standardized design that contrasted sharply with the "messy" customization of MySpace. This shift wasn’t just about design; it reflected deeper social and economic attitudes. People were drawn to the minimalist, controlled environment of Facebook, where professionalism and order were emphasized. As the web became more integrated into daily life, it inevitably became "whitewashed," in a sense—stripped clean of all personality in favor of appearing professional and polished. Wagner relates this to the "white flight" of the time, stating, "cultural attitudes from what was then the beginning of the domination of the internet by professional-class companies such as Facebook explain precisely why some users chose to abandon MySpace and the vernacular web—a place where they possessed far greater agency—in favor of the streamlined and aesthetically regulated Facebook. The answer was class aspiration, often along racial lines, a phenomenon compared to the urban white flight of the mid-twentieth century." This speaks to a desire for status and respectability, but it also resulted in the loss of agency and creativity that once defined the web.</p>
          <p>This cycle of nostalgia for a more creative past is a powerful commentary on how capitalism has shaped the web. As the article suggests, "Nostalgia, I’m reminded, is profitable and it remains one of the easiest to execute and cheapest grifts of neoliberal culture." Rather than promoting innovation, the current internet has become a space where creativity is stifled and monetized. The very platforms that once allowed people to run wild with their ideas have been replaced by corporate-controlled environments that limit freedom. And while nostalgia remains profitable, it’s ultimately a reminder of what has been lost—a web where users could shape their own digital landscapes and create new experiences that could one day become the nostalgia of tomorrow.</p>
